# AMS595_Assignment1

## Documentation of Assignment 01
Q1: Use the “if” statement to make sure the input number is in the required range. Then, the key point is the string and integer conversion. Make sure the typed data is the form which could be accepted by the code. 
Q2: For this question, we first check the data is in square (n x n) matrix, then make sure the dimensions of A and b are compatible and perform Gaussian elimination. Finally use Back-substitution to find x.
Q3: In part A, the key point is to use the “for” loop to keep generating the points to fill up the circle, and use the circle equation to define the shape. Then in part B, We first Measure execution time, then we use the function detail which in part A to join to the running parts make the effect of part A could be used in part B. Then, we Store needed data to do the figure plots.

## Here is the result of plot
